# Service Design Specification

**asd-ser-service** documentation
-Version:**`1.0.0`**

## Scope

This document provides a structured architectural overview of the `ser` microservice, detailing its configuration, data model, authorization logic, business rules, and API design. It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

- **Service architects** can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
- **Developers and maintainers** will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
- **Stakeholders and reviewers** can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.

> **Note for Frontend Developers**: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the [Service API Documentation](#) for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

> **Note for Backend Developers**: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.

### Service Overview

This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port `3000`,
serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

- **API Test Interface (API Face):** `/`
- **Swagger Documentation:** `/swagger`
- **Postman Collection Download:** `/getPostmanCollection`
- **Health Checks:** `/health` and `/admin/health`
- **Current Session Info:** `/currentuser`
- **Favicon:** `/favicon.ico`

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `asd-ser-service`.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

- **Preview:** `https://asd8.prw.mindbricks.com/ser-api`
- **Staging:** `https://ser-api.asd8.staging.mindbricks.com`
- **Production:** `https://ser-api.asd8.prod.mindbricks.com`

### Authentication & Security

- **Login Required**: Yes

This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity.
If a crud route also is configured to require login,
it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

### Service Data Objects

The service uses a **PostgreSQL** database for data storage, with the database name set to `asd-ser-service`.

Data deletion is managed using a **soft delete** strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the `isActive` field to `false`.

No data objects defined for this service.

## Integration Patterns

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Configuration

- **HTTP Port**: `3000`
- **Database Type**: MongoDB
- **Global Soft Delete**: Enabled

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

1. **Data Model Implementation**: Generate database schema from data object definitions
2. **CRUD Route Generation**: Implement auto-generated routes with custom logic
3. **Custom Logic Integration**: Implement hook functions and edge functions
4. **Authentication Integration**: Configure with project-level authentication
5. **Testing**: Unit and integration testing for all components

### Code Generation Expectations

- **Database Schema**: Auto-generated from data objects and relationships
- **API Routes**: REST endpoints with customizable behavior
- **Validation Logic**: Input validation from property definitions
- **Access Control**: Authentication and authorization middleware

### Custom Code Integration Points

- **Hook Functions**: Lifecycle-specific custom logic
- **Edge Functions**: Full request/response control
- **Library Functions**: Reusable business logic
- **Templates**: Dynamic content rendering

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing

- Test all custom library functions
- Test validation logic and business rules
- Test hook function implementations

#### Integration Testing

- Test API endpoints with authentication scenarios
- Test database operations and transactions
- Test external integrations
- Test event emission and Kafka integration

#### Performance Testing

- Load test high-traffic endpoints
- Test caching effectiveness
- Monitor database query performance
- Test scalability under load

### Enum Value Mappings

#### Request Locations

- `0`: Bearer token in Authorization header
- `1`: Cookie value
- `2`: Custom HTTP header
- `3`: Query parameter
- `4`: Request body property
- `5`: URL path parameter
- `6`: Session data
- `7`: Root request object

#### HTTP Methods

- `0`: GET
- `1`: POST
- `2`: PUT
- `3`: PATCH
- `4`: DELETE

### Edge Function Signature

```javascript
async function edgeFunction(request) {
  // Custom request processing
  // Return response object or throw error
  return {
    data: {},
    status: 200,
    message: "Success",
  };
}
```
